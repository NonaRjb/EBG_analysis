## Introduction
This is a Python implementation of the experiments conducted for the project "*Towards Olfactory Brain-Computer Interfaces: A Feasibility Study*". 
The codes can be dividid into:
-  Dataset-related
-  Model-related
-  Training-related
scripts. Models are either neural networks or classic machine learning models such as logistic regression and suport vector machines. The training code for each group is in a separate file. Code for model architectures are under the *models* directory.
EBG4 stands represents the dataset that we used to train and evaluate the model. All dataset-related files are stored under the *dataset* directory.
